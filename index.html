          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I'm a Computer Science student who is currently taking the Computer Systems Technology program at BCIT. I've been passionate about technology my whole life, and that passion started when I first picked up a video game. Playing video games is
            how I mainly interacted with technology, until one day when I stopped and started wondering how the game was actually programmed. Ever since then, I became more and more interested about how every website I visited or every app that I downloaded
            was designed, and that curiosity is what led me to discover my love for programming.
            <br>
            <p> I enjoy learning, both in and out of school. In my free time, I love to work on my personal projects and learn new aspects of programming. </p>

              <h1>Snake</h1>
              <p> While learning javascript, I made a two dimensional Snake game, much like the arcade version. This game runs in your browser and is built using p5.js, a javascript library. This game also keeps keeps track of your current score as well as
                your highest score while you play. In order to gain some experience with object-oreinated programming, I used aspects of object-oreinated javascript while building this game, such as using constructor functions. <br>

              <h1>2 Player Pong</h1>
              <p class="col-xs-12"> 2 Player Pong is another personal project where, with the help of some tutorials, I used javascript and p5.js in order to build a visual game. This game is very similar to the arcade video game Pong, where two players use their paddles to
                hit a ball back and forth, in order to try and score points. This game also keeps tracks of the player scores, and it also displays a message showing who won once a player reaches 5 points. <br>

              <h1> PHP Math Game</h1>
              <p> This is a project which I worked on for a school assignment. This is a simple Math Game that was made entirely with PHP. The game picks two random numbers between 0 and 50, and tells the user to either add them or subtract them. It then
                informs the reader if their answer was correct or not. Another feature of this game is that it contains a functioning login page, and without logging in with the correct credentials, it is impossible to access the game.
                <br>
                <br> Sample Login:
                <br> Username: a@a.a
                <br> Password: aaa

              <h1>Random Quote Generator</h1>
              <p>This is a personal project that I made to further my understanding of AJAX, JSON and APIs. This project uses the Forismatic API and AJAX requests to get random quotes and display them to users. no quotes have been hardcoded, and all quotes
                are fetched from the API randomly. Furthermore, This page changes to a random color each time the "get new quote button" is pressed. I also added a button that lets the user tweet the current quote that they are viewing.
                <br> The idea for this project came from FreeCodeCamp. <br>
